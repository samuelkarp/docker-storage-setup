docker\-storage\-setup - Grows the root filesystem and sets up storage for docker.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\f[B]docker-storage-setup\f[] [OPTIONS]
.SH OPTIONS
.PP

  Print usage statement

.SH EXAMPLES
Run \f[B]docker-storage-setup\f[] after setting up your configuration in
/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup. One can look at
/usr/lib/docker-storage-setup/docker-storage-setup for various options and
their default settings. Anything user wants to change, should be changed
in /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup. This is the file which will
override any settings specified in /usr/lib/docker-storage-setup/docker-storage-setup.

lvm2 version should be same or higher than lvm2-2.02.112 for lvm thin pool
functionality to work properly.

\f[B]Supported options for the configuration file\f[]:

STORAGE_DRIVER:
      Specify a storage driver to be used with docker. Default
      driver is "devicemapper". Other valid values are "overlay"
      and "". Empty string tells docker-storage-setup to not do
      any storage setup.

DEVS: A quoted, space-separated list of devices to be used.
      If a drive is partitioned and contains a ${dev}1 partition,
      that partition will be configured for use. Unpartitioned
      drives will be partitioned and configured for use. If "VG"
      is not specified, then use of the root disk's extra space
      is implied.

VG:   The volume group to use for docker storage.  Defaults to the
      volume group where the root filesystem resides.  If VG is
      specified and the volume group does not exist, it will be
      created (which requires that "DEVS" be nonempty, since we don't
      currently support putting a second partition on the root disk).

      lvm2 version should be same or higher than lvm2-2.02.112 for lvm
      thin pool functionality to work properly.

GROWPART:
      One can use this option to enable/disable growing of partition
      table backing root volume group. This is intended for
      virtualization and cloud installations. By default it is
      disabled. Use GROWPART=true to enable automatic partition
      table resizing.

AUTO_EXTEND_POOL:
      Enable automatic extension of pool by lvm. lvm can monitor
      the pool and automatically extend it when pool is getting full.

POOL_AUTOEXTEND_THRESHOLD:
      Determines the pool extension threshold in terms of percentage
      of pool size. For example, if threshold is 60, that means when
      pool is 60% full, threshold has been hit.

POOL_AUTOEXTEND_PERCENT:
      Determines the amount by which pool needs to be grown. This is
      specified in terms of % of pool size. So a value of 20 means
      that when threshold is hit, pool will be grown by 20% of existing
      pool size.

CHUNK_SIZE:
      Controls the chunk size/block size of thin pool. Value of CHUNK_SIZE
      be suitable to be passed to --chunk-size option of lvconvert.

LV_ERROR_WHEN_FULL
      Controls the LV behavior when full. Default behavior is controlled by
      lvm.conf. Setting LV_ERROR_WHEN_FULL=yes forces the LV to error when
      writes are attempted rather than queuing.

The options below should be specified as values acceptable to 'lvextend -L':

ROOT_SIZE: The size to which the root filesystem should be grown.

DATA_SIZE: The desired size for the docker data LV.  Defaults to using
           40% free space in the VG after the root LV and docker
           metadata LV have been allocated/grown.

           DATA_SIZE can take values acceptable to "lvcreate -L" as
           well as some values acceptable to "lvcreate -l". If user
           intends to pass values acceptable to "lvcreate -l", then
           only those values which contains "%" in syntax are
           acceptable.  If value does not contain "%" it is assumed
           value is suitable for "lvcreate -L".

MIN_DATA_SIZE:
           Specifies the minimum size of the data volume. If sufficient
           free space is not available, the pool creation will fail.

           Value should be a number followed by a optional suffix.
           "bBsSkKmMgGtTpPeE" are valid suffixes. If no suffix is
           specified then value will be considered as megabyte unit.

           Both upper and lower case suffix represent same unit of
           size. Use suffix B for Bytes, S for sectors as 512 bytes, K
           for kibibytes (1024 bytes), M for mebibytes
           (1024 kibibytes), G for gibibytes, T for tebibytes, P for
           pebibytes and E for exbibytes.
